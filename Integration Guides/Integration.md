### I. Installation

1. Add the following dependencies in `Podfile`:
	```
	pod 'HaptikLib'
	pod 'NativeSSOLogin', :git=>'https://bitbucket.org/agi_sso/nativessologin.git', :tag => '1.0.12'
	```

2. Run `pod install`

---

### II. Required Permissions

HaptikLib requires some permissions and custom properties to function.
Add the following snippets in your `info.plist` file -

1. Allow arbitrary network loads to be requested

	```
	<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
	  <dict>
	       <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
	       <true/>
	  </dict>
	```

2. Haptik only supports Portrait orientation

	```
	<key>UISupportedInterfaceOrientations</key>
	<array>
	<string>UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait</string>
	</array>
	```

3. Privacy - Photo Library Usage Description to enable a user to upload photos from the photos gallery in the chat flows

	```
	<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
	<string>To enable usage & saving of photos</string
	<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
	<string>To enable usage & saving of photos</string>
	```

4. Privacy - Camera Usage Description to enable a user to upload photos from camera within chat flows

	```
	<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
	<string>To enable camera usage for uploading photos</string>
	```

---


### III. Initialization

1. The Haptik SDK should be initialized before it can perform any operations
2. *Initialization* here implies providing appropriate **API Key**, **Client ID**, **Base URL** & **Run Environment** to Haptik SDK
3. The following `key-value` pairs should be present in the Custom Dictionary `HaptikLib`:

	| Key 					| Value					 |
	|-----------------------|--------------------|
	|apiKey								|INSERT_API_KEY_HERE|
	|baseUrl							|INSERT_BASE_URL_HERE|
	|clientID							|INSERT_CLIENT_ID_HERE|
	|runEnvironment							|INSERT_APPROPRIATE_RUN_ENVIRONMENT|

4. The Haptik SDK takes all the necessary things from app's `Info.plist` file automatically
5. Add these initialization keys substituted with their appropriate values in a custom dictionary named `HaptikLib`
6. On opening app's `Info.plist` in _Source Code_ format & add the required keys as illustrated below -

	```
	<key>HaptikLib</key>
	<dict>
	  <key>apiKey</key>
	  <string>INSERT_API_KEY_HERE</string>
	  <key>baseUrl</key>
	  <string>INSERT_BASE_URL_HERE</string>
	  <key>clientID</key>
	  <string>INSERT_CLIENT_ID_HERE</string>
	  <key>runEnvironment</key>
	  <string>INSERT_APPROPRIATE_RUN_ENVIRONMENT</string>
	</dict>
	```

	**Note:** The Base URL will be different for different `runEnvironment` as specified below -

	```
	HaptikLibEnvProduction = 0,
	HaptikLibEnvStaging = 1,
	HaptikLibEnvDev = 2
	```
---


### IV. AppDelegate Configurations

1. Import HaptikLib in your AppDelegate Class
	```
	@import HaptikLib;
	```

2. Haptik uses the *application* instance and the *launchOptions* dictionary internally. The `Haptik.h` class provides a method to pass the required parameters.

	```
	- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {

	   ...

	   [[Haptik sharedSDK] notifyApplication:application launchedWithOptions:launchOptions];    

	   return YES;
	}
	```

3. Haptik internally also opens urls which the client needs to return it true.


    ```
    (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)app openURL:(NSURL *)url options:(NSDictionary<UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsKey,id> *)options {

      ...

      BOOL isRedirectHandledByHaptik = [[Haptik sharedSDK] isRedirectHandled:url options:options];

      return isRedirectHandledByHaptik;
    }
    ```

4. Haptik can also be configured to send Push Notifications to the user. The client application needs to configure push notifications on their own end and have to pass the deviceToken which the application gets after requesting the user to send them Push Notifications.

	```
	- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData *)deviceToken {

	    ...

	    [[Haptik sharedSDK] setDeviceToken:deviceToken];
	}
	```

5. For Haptik to handle it's own notifications, you have to pass the **notification dictionary** that you get in the **notifications payload** and the instance of the `viewController` from where the notifications should be handled. It's also possible to determine whether notification payload is Haptik-specific or not.

	```
	- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)userInfo {

	     ...

	     BOOL canBeHandledByHaptik = [[Haptik sharedSDK] canHandleNotificationWithUserInfo:response.notification.request.content.userInfo];

	     if (canBeHandledByHaptik) {
		 NSLog(@"do housekeeping");
		 [[Haptik sharedSDK] handleNotificationWithUserInfo:PASS_NOTIFICATION_DICTIONARY_HERE controller:PASS_VIEWCONTROLLER_INSTANCE_HERE;
	     }
	}
	```

### V. User Authentication

1. After successful Initialization & App Delegate Configuration, SDK can enable a user to Signup for using Haptik services
2. Haptik Signup is sub-divided in following 2 parts -
	- Collecting required parameters of user according to Signup Type: _Guest_ or _Verified_ user
	- Passing over the collected parameters to Haptik

###### Signup Types

Haptik gives a public class `HPSignUpObject` which you can use to collect the required parameters. Each auth flows require a different set of parameters passed to HPSignUpObject. Contact Haptik for knowing more about your `Auth-Type` & `Auth-ID`.

This class follows the builder pattern. Here's an example of how to make use of it:

```
HPSignUpObject *signupObj = [HPSignUpObject buildWithAuthType:@"AUTH_TYPE_HERE" data:^(HPSignUpBuilder * _Nonnull builder) {

        builder.userFullName = INSERT_NAME_HERE;
        builder.userPhoneNumber = INSERT_PHONE_NUMBER_HERE;
        builder.userEmail = INSERT_EMAIL_HERE;
        builder.userCity = INSERT_CITY_HERE;
        builder.authToken = INSERT_AUTH_TOKEN_HERE;
        builder.authID = INSERT_AUTH_ID_HERE;
    }];   
```

- **Basic Auth**

  **Auth_Type = @"basic";**

	Basic Authentication is a guest form of signup that does not require any sort of server-server/ 3rd party verification. This is ideal for chat bots that are either informational in nature or where user identity is handled by a 3rd party provider.

	The following parameter is required while signing up with **BASIC** authType:

	- *Optional*: Name


  > Although name is optional, but it is recommended to provide user's name as it does help in customising user experience.


- **OTP**

  **Auth_Type = @"otp";**

	An end userâ€™s mobile number OTP verification can be done by Haptik. Please contact us for utilising this feature.

  The following parameter is compulsory while signing up with **OTP** authType:

  - *Mandatory*: OTP Verified Mobile Number
  - *Mandatory*: Token/TicketId for OTP verification (for 3-way handshake, creation of Wallet)
  - *Optional*: Resident City
	- *Optional*: Email (unverified is OK)


> **NOTE** that city name **MUST** be either one of the cities mentioned on Haptik SDK or provide "Other" as a String.

**City Appendix**:
	```
	[@"Mumbai", @"Bombay"]

	[@"New Delhi", @"Delhi"]

	[@"Bengaluru", @"Bangalore", @"Bengaluru South"]

	[@"Chennai", @"Madras"]

	[@"Pune", @"Poona"]

	[@"Hyderabad", @"Secunderabad"]

	[@"Kolkata", @"Calcutta"]

	[@"Ahmedabad", @"Ahmadabad"]

	[@"Thane", @"Mira Bhayandar", @"Mira Bhayander"]

	[@"Navi Mumbai"]

	[@"Gurugram", @"Gurgaon"]

	[@"Noida", @"Greater Noida"]
	```

### VI. User Signup Flow

To continue from the User Authentication, the signUp object is now passed to Haptik for signing up the user. Signing up the user is an API call and can take up some time. Haptik provides two different ways for that, one with a customised loading screen and other without it.

###### Type I  (Without Loading Screen)

Haptik defines a method that takes up the `HPSignUpObject` and returns the a `UIViewController` instance for you to push in the completion after the user has successfully signed up. The completion is returned on `mainQueue` by default.

Here an example:

```
[[Haptik sharedSDK] signUpWith:signupObj completion:^(BOOL success, UIViewController * _Nullable initialVC, NSError * _Nullable error) {

        if (success) {
            [self.navigationController pushViewController:initialVC animated:YES];
        }
    }];
```

###### Type II (With Loading Screen)

This method also takes the same parameters just as the above method takes. The key difference is that the function returns a `UIViewController` instance to push immediately irrespectively if the API call is still in progress. The returned view controller itself takes up the responsibility of showing the customised loading screen and the switching back to the desired `Inbox View`.

Here an example:

```
UIViewController * __block initialVC = [[Haptik sharedSDK] signUpWithLoadingScreenFor:signupObj completion:^(BOOL success, NSError * _Nullable error) {

        if (success) {                        
        }
        else {            
        }
    }];    

    [self.navigationController pushViewController:initialVC animated:YES];
```

This viewController takes custom text attributes individually to display the titles and subtitles on the Loading Screen. `Haptik.h` declares two properties named:

- loadingTitleText:

	- **Default text**: @"Behind every successful person is an Assistant!"


- loadingSubtitleText:

	- **Default text**: @"Coming right upâ€¦"

You can set these properties before pushing the viewController and set the `title` & `subtitle` text on the loading screen, otherwise default text will be set. It is highly recommended to show this viewController while user is signing up on Haptik SDK to make a smooth user experience.

---


### VII. Existing Users flow

You need to handle the flow where the user has already signed up and you want to directly take the user to Haptik's `Inbox Screen`. Haptik provides a function named `isUserSignedUp` that returns a `BOOL` value for the same. If `YES` you can get the desired `viewController` from the method `getInitialVC` and push the user directly. The function will return `nil` if the user hasn't been signed up.

##### Example:

```
if ([[Haptik sharedSDK] isUserSignedUp]) {

        [self.navigationController pushViewController:[[Haptik sharedSDK] getInitialVC] animated:YES];
    }
    else {

        // Continue with the SignUp flow here
    }
```

---


## VIII. Share Functionality

Haptik provides inbuilt share functionality where user can share the client app with others via social media apps or any other medium.

- When user shares something from inside the HaptikSDK, a **custom content message** gets shared. Client can **override this message** with their own custom content along with their `deeplink` URL.

- Haptik also provides an inbuilt feature where it can take the users **directly to the client applicationâ€™s App Store Page** to rate the application.

The option to set these values is given in the `Info.plist` file of the application.

> If the values are not added then by default Haptik is shared with its custom text.

You have add a **Dictionary** inside the `HaptikLib` dictionary which you added for credentials during the initialization. Note that the keys should match the provided keys otherwise default behaviour will be implemented.

The dictionary should be named `shareAndRate` and the following **key-value** should be present in it:

| Key 									| Value							 |
|-----------------------|--------------------|
|appStoreUrl						|INSERT_APP_STORE_URL|
|shareText							|INSERT_SHARE_TEXT|
|shareUrl								|INSERT_SHARE_URL|

##### Example:

```
<key>HaptikLib</key>
	<dict>		
		<key>apiKey</key>
		<string>INSERT_API_KEY_HERE</string>
		<key>baseUrl</key>
		<string>INSERT_BASE_URL_HERE</string>
		<key>clientID</key>
		<string>INSERT_CLIENT_ID_HERE</string>
		<key>runEnvironment</key>
		<string>INSERT_APPROPRIATE_RUN_ENVIRONMENT</string>

		***

		<key>shareAndRate</key>
		<dict>
			<key>appStoreUrl</key>
			<string>INSERT_APP_STORE_URL</string>
			<key>shareText</key>
			<string>INSERT_SHARE_TEXT</string>
			<key>shareUrl</key>
			<string>INSERT_SHARE_URL</string>
		</dict>

		***

	</dict>
```

> Inside the shareText wherever there will be %@ present, it will be replaced by the shareUrl.
